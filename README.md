**Auto Travels : A Vehicle Management System**

Auto Travels is a comprehensive vehicle management system designed to streamline vehicle tracking, rental management, and information storage. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in full-stack application development, utilizing a range of modern technologies.

- **Frontend:** Developed using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. The frontend allows users to interact with the system seamlessly, managing vehicle information and rental processes efficiently.
- **Backend:** Built with Spring Boot and Hibernate, ensuring robust and scalable server-side operations. The backend handles all business logic, data processing, and communication between the frontend and database.
- **Database:** Utilizes a relational database, managed by Spring Bootâ€™s integrated data access features, to store and retrieve vehicle data, rental records, and user information.

**Project Features:**
- **Vehicle Management:** Allows users to view, add, update, and delete vehicle records.
- **Rental Management:** Facilitates the rental process, including tracking rented vehicles and managing rental statuses.
- **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing vehicle and rental information.

**Development Status:**
This project was developed as an individual effort to enhance my proficiency in full-stack development. While the core functionalities have been implemented, there are additional features and refinements still in progress. Please consider this as an ongoing project, with future updates and improvements planned to enhance its capabilities and user experience.
